# About

Codi grew up in the Coloradan Rocky Mountains, where she practiced skiing, rock
climbing, and hiking. Her adventurous spirit eventually led her to the Chilean
Patagonia, where she now resides. She makes a living teaching English and
translating.

She developed her Spanish language skills at Lewis & Clark College in Portland,
Oregon where she majored in Hispanic Studies and International Affairs. Codi
also studied abroad at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso for six
months. Extensive time studying, traveling, and working have made her fluent.
